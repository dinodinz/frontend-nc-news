- **Phospor Icons** (for icon components)
- **Vite** (For easily previewing your react work)

## Summary:

This is something similar to Reddit where people can share and post articles and also comment and vote on them. Built by React components.

## Dependencies

You might need to install the minimum dependency versions shown on the package.json file to avoid any issues when running the app

If you have installed recent updated versions and are having issues, then installing the exact versions would be the best option.

To do this you need to use "npm ci" instead of "npm i" as this will install the exact versions on the package.json file.

## Setup on your local machine

1.) Go here https://github.com/dinodinz/frontend-nc-news

2.) Grab the HTTPS URL by clicking the green button "<> Code"

3.) Go to your machine terminal and run "git clone CODE_URL_HERE"

4.) Open the directory inside your IDE

5.) Run "npm ci" on your terminal to install the exact versions of all dependencies on the package.json file

6.) Run "npm run dev" to build a server using Vite.

7.) Preview the project by clicking the localhost server provided.

Alternatively, you can use the live link here: https://ncnewstagram.netlify.app/

## Important:
 It may take a few seconds for this project to fetch data on initial render as API endpoints will need to boot up after long periods of inactivity.
